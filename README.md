It is a subject to practice SIGNAL in C

The subject introduction

Mandatory Part
ou must create a communication program in the form of a client and a server.
• The server must be started first. After its launch, it has to print its PID.
• The client takes two parameters:
    ◦ The server PID.
    ◦ The string to send.
• The client must send the string passed as a parameter to the server.
• Once the string has been received, the server must print it.
• The server has to display the string pretty quickly. Quickly means that if you think it takes too long, then it is probably too long.
• Your server should be able to receive strings from several clients in a row without needing to restart.
• The communication between your client and your server has to be done only using UNIX signals.
• You can only use these two signals: SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2.

Bonus part
• The server acknowledges every message received by sending back a signal to the client.
• Unicode characters support!
